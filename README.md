## Python Assessment

> **Important Note:**  For the type checking, data types excluded from the 4 given in [PROBLEM.md](PROBLEM.md) , e.g boolean(true/false), empty arrays [] and also attributes whose values are JSON objects , were ignored in the function and were automatically set to `null` when the schema was generated


### Unittests
I wrote 4 different unittests using the `unittest` library in python

To run the tests
```console

python test.py
```

The test script runs test cases for the different information , these include:
- padding 
- excluding the attributes key 
- setting required=False
- setting the 4 different datatypes
